# A Free And Easy To Use Typing Test
### the testing documents are already included and randomized, however, if you like you may set up your own api and write the first lines of code in main.py to suit your needs for different text. If you go this route i do suggest you look at the api file which is a small OOP file but should be pretty easy to figure out.

#### Typing Speed Tester is currently a very ugly, yet simple to use application with just a few button clicks necessary to get going. Begin and Next buttons are all you really have to click.


##### The visuals are high contrast, yet not too hard against the eyes it will allow you to see easily.  I still need to make a settings section so you can change different fonts and sizes and colors and such.
